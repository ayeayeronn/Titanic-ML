# Titanic-ML

The purpose of this project is to build various Machine Learning Classification Models (Null, KNN, Boosted C5.0, Random Forest, Logistic Regression using regularlization, and Naive Bayes), subsetting the Titanic dataset (courtesy of Kaggle) into training and testing data then determining which model performs the best. Model performances are evaluated using confusion matrices. Once the best model has been determined, predictions are produced in the form of a .csv file.
